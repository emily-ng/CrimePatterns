Built for the CS336 (Intro to Databases) final project.

Our project aimed show any patterns and correlations in data related to marijuana (sales, possession) and violent crime in the US.

We collected data from multiple tables from the FBI at https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s and created a relational database using Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS).

Then we used Ruby on Rails to build our application and Bootstrap to style it.

To deploy our web app, we used Heroku.

Note, this project is no longer being maintained.
